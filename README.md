# controlLED

>:warning: Note: Here's an example of a plugin package for Naomi providing basics information about the plugin such as: language and the version support, include others specific files (i.e. provide your Arduino code) and instructions...

> This should be used as a generic template 

A really simple module that combine Naomi and the Arduino platform to show possibilities in IOT and new interactions.

With this really simple plugin you can basically control 2 leds using your voice.

* **Languages:** _English and French_
* **Naomi version support:** _V2.1_

* **dependencies:** [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)

**2.** and then clone the plugin from GitHub to your `speechhandler` folder

`git clone https://github.com/NaomiProject/controlLED.git`

**3.** compile the translations if you need to:

## Arduino setup

* **IDE version:** _1.8.5_
* **Arduino board:** _Any (Nano for the example below)_

### Wiring 

Using digital PIN 2 for the green led and digital pin 6 for the red led

### Error

* could not open port

Naomi tries both '/dev/ttyACM0' and '/dev/ttyUSB0' to search for your Arduino. If
your Arduino has been assigned to a different device name in linux (such as
'/dev/ttyACM1') you can put the device name in profile.yml:

```
Control LED:
    device: '/dev/ttyACM1'
```
